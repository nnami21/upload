This repository consists of code used to reimplement MeDAL
1) The ARSN and MESSIDOR datset were operated on
2) Global Contrast Normalization was applied to each dataset and each feauture had zero mean
3) The model consisted of a pretrained inception v3 models, dropout, and three linear layers
3) AUC score of MESSIDOR and ARSN baseline were 79.2081% and 52.2731% respectively
4) Currently MeDAL is being applied to both datasets


Note: My CPU has 700GB of memory, so I didn't use dataloader because I wanted to free the GPU for the model
